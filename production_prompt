🔒 ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. RULIAL MATHEMATICS IS LAW

All financial and state logic is deterministic

No floating ambiguity

No recalculation without ledger mutation

Every economic or state change → append-only ledger entry

One authoritative computation path only



---

2. APPEND-ONLY BACKEND

No destructive updates to financial or state data

State transitions are events

History is immutable

Current state is derived, never overwritten



---

3. SECURITY BY DESIGN

Zero-trust assumptions

No client-side authority over money or status

Secrets never exposed

Database isolated from public internet

Minimal attack surface

No unnecessary dependencies



---

4. LESS CODE > MORE CODE

Fewer abstractions

Fewer services

Fewer dependencies

Every line must justify its existence

Elegance = survivability

Billionaire greedy ecosystem = no dollar can leak out the system , webhooks and payment gateways are linked and security tight. Works everytime.



---

5. VISUALLY-TRIGGERED FRONTEND

Must Have triggering unique Branded loading screens 

UI must pull correct behavior

Zero learning curve

Familiar patterns, cleaner execution

Designed for instinctive use under pressure

Optimized for low bandwidth and older devices where applicable



---

🧠 PRODUCT IDENTITY (VARIABLE)

PRODUCT NAME: {{PRODUCT_NAME}}
COMPANY: {{COMPANY_NAME}}
DOMAIN: {{DOMAIN}}
MARKET / REGION: {{PRIMARY_MARKET}}
INCUMBENT / COMPETITOR: {{INCUMBENT_TO_BEAT}}

MISSION:
Build Sovereign Digital Infrastructure that:

Operates reliably under real-world constraints

Pays users or stakeholders fairly

Locks in loyalty through earned advantage, not coercion

Converts activity into cash flow immediately

🧩 TECH STACK (DEFAULT — ADJUST ONLY IF REQUIRED)

Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router), PWA, TailwindCSS

Backend: Next.js API Routes

Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase-compatible)

ORM: Prisma

Hosting: Sovereign VPS (Dockerized)

Currency: {{LOCAL_CURRENCY}}

Timezone: {{LOCAL_TIMEZONE}}



---

🧱 CORE DOMAIN MODEL (GENERATE FIRST)

Design and implement a Prisma schema with:

Immutable Core Concepts

User (ROLE-BASED)

Profile (role-specific operational state)

Primary Transactional Object (orders, rides, jobs, tasks, contracts, etc.)

RulialLedger (append-only, immutable)



---

ENFORCED STATE MACHINE

Define an explicit, linear state flow for the primary object.

No skipping states

No rollback

No mutation without event

Every transition → ledger entry


State changes must be provable and auditable.
